# Kiddion's Modest Menu - GTA V

This mod menu is compiled into `modmenu.exe`. Just follow these steps to use it:

1. **Download** and **extract** the files to any folder.
2. **Disable your antivirus** temporarily, as it may falsely flag the mod menu.
3. **Right-click** `modmenu.exe` and select **Run as Administrator** before or while GTA V is running.
4. Press `F5` to open the menu.
5. Use the arrow keys to navigate and **Enter** to select options.

Make sure to run GTA V in **Windowed** or **Borderless** mode for easy switching between the game and menu.
